"Many engineering students and developers struggle to build a strong intuition for Data Structures and Algorithms because most learning resources are static, that only show the final result, not the intermediate steps. This leads to rote memorization of formulas and code templates instead of conceptual understanding, which directly impacts coding interview performance and problem-solving skills. To address this, the proposed solution provides an interactive visualization of DSA concepts. Gemini AI is integrated to enhance real-time 3D simulation of data structures and also explain current state of structures. This helps learners understand internal working more intuitively.
The 3D representation allows users to view data movement from different angles, improving spatial and logical understanding. As a result ,learning becomes clearer, engaging, and more effective. Detailed theory sections explain each concept. Quizzes are included after every topic to help learners test their understanding instantly. Practice questions of varying difficulty encourage hands-on learning and problem-solving".
